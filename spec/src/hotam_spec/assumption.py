"""Canon: §Assumption — a claim with its OWN lifecycle (the root of context drift).

An Assumption is a statement the requirements rest on but that the world can
falsify independently ("there is a single customer per account"; "api_version
>= 3"). It is the mechanism behind the THIRD invisibility — context drift: a
requirement was meaningful under assumption X, X is long false, nobody revisited
it. That is only catchable because the assumption carries its own status.

WHY assumptions are first-class (not prose inside a requirement): conflicts and
requirements INHERIT drift. When an Assumption flips to DEAD, every Conflict and
Requirement resting on it must light up at once — one trigger re-opens a whole
semantic cluster (see graph.dead_assumptions + graph.requirements_on_assumption
and what_now's dead-assumption fallout). A shared assumption interpreted two different ways is
also frequently the REAL root of a Conflict (Conflict.shared_assumption).

Lifecycle (the source of truth is the `status` field, params.py-style):
  HOLDS     — currently believed true.               [epistemic — a fact-claim]
  UNCERTAIN — under question; not yet falsified, not safely relied on.
                                                      [epistemic — a fact-claim]
  DEAD      — known false; everything resting on it must be revisited.
                                                      [epistemic — a fact-claim]
  IMPLEMENTS — an ASPIRATION: not a claim about what the world IS, but a
               statement of what we STRIVE to make true ('we are trying to do
               this, we want this'). [VOLITIONAL — not epistemic]

RULE (IMPLEMENTS, R-assumption-implements-state): IMPLEMENTS is a fourth,
VOLITIONAL род of status, categorically distinct from the three epistemic
statuses (HOLDS/UNCERTAIN/DEAD, which answer 'is this true?'). IMPLEMENTS
answers 'do we want this to become true, and are we working toward it?'. Three
consequences follow directly from its non-epistemic nature and are enforced by
the filters/predicates that key off exact status equality:
  (a) the UNCERTAIN-aging predicate does NOT touch it — an aspiration is not an
      unresolved doubt, so it raises no P4 review-debt signal (see
      graph.uncertain_assumptions, what_now's UNCERTAIN-aging band);
  (b) it is NEVER counted as DEAD-fallout — nothing rests on a broken premise,
      because an aspiration is not (yet) a premise (see graph.dead_assumptions,
      reflection.reflect_dead_assumption_on_enforcer);
  (c) legitimate transitions and their signoff (the transition table lives in
      §Proposal — ProposedAssumptionTransition): IMPLEMENTS→HOLDS ('achieved,
      became fact'), IMPLEMENTS→DEAD ('abandoned the striving'),
      UNCERTAIN→IMPLEMENTS ('we understood this is not a fact but a goal') and
      HOLDS→IMPLEMENTS ('we declared it fact too early') — ALL four require a
      human decided_by. Agent entry WITHOUT signoff remains UNCERTAIN-only.

WHY a distinct род rather than reusing HOLDS: re-affirming a doubted premise as
HOLDS is a factual lie when the truth is 'this is not yet true but we are
building toward it'. Collapsing aspiration into HOLDS would silence the
UNCERTAIN-aging review signal under a false FACT-claim; IMPLEMENTS silences the
doubt-signal HONESTLY, by re-typing the claim from fact to goal. The
UNCERTAIN→IMPLEMENTS transition therefore CHANGES the род of the claim and
removes a live P4 doubt signal — by the Wave-12 asymmetry (a transition that
reduces live signal needs a named human) it REQUIRES a decided_by, unlike the
signal-RAISING move to plain UNCERTAIN.
