"""Canon: §Proposal — structured operator-→-steward change proposals.

The closed loop's ACT half: the AI operator emits a structured proposal
(ProposedRequirement / ProposedConflictTransition / ProposedRejection), the
steward approves it (out-of-band: review + greenlight), and tools/apply_proposal.py
mechanically writes the change to spec/content/graph.py + runs the regen+verify
pipeline. No free-text AI editing of source.

This honors R-ai-presents-not-decides (the AI never closes a conflict silently)
AND R-active-loop-playbooks (each what_now band has a playbook + a mechanical
apply path).
